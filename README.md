# BTSI
## A Bayesian hierarchical model for assimilating direct and indirect observations of total solar irradiance (TSI), producing joint estimate of TSI, TSI uncertainty, and observation error.

## Getting started
Download BTSI to a Matlab directory. Running the MCMC model requires running runchain_22_04_25.m from the main project directory, a formatted array of observations (obsmatrix), prior hyperparameters for the observation model, and an observation mask array for observations that are excised. 

A completed observation mask array and set of prior hyperparameters are located within the /mat_files directory as excludeMask_22_11_03.mat and obspriors_22_06_23.mat, respectively. An array of observers, updated as of November 3 2022, is located in /mat_files as obs_22_11_03.mat. 

To run runchain_22_04_25.m, first open the runchain_22_04_25.m script and edit any desired headers under "Headers to modify", including the name and path of the output, the observation array to be used, and any alternative model specifications one would like to use.

## Manuscript plots
gplots_22_10_25.m and plotsupp_22_11_02.m reproduce the figures and tables cited in Amdur and Huybers 23 and shown in the plots folder. These scripts assume access to specific BTSI model outputs performed by the lead author. To request the mat files needed to run these scripts, please contact the corresponding author in Amdur and Huybers 23.
